# DOT-SHIM project

My DOT-SHIM (mini-HAT) for Raspberry Pi.

Some time ago I have tried to attach something self-made schematics to a zero Pi with some limited success.
Now I've designed a 2.54mm raster board for DIY applications.

Some useful links:

- [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) - a brilliant resource on topic of Pi's pinout and HATs.
